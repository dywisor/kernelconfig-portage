	The CADOS / VAMOS project

	Topic of the project is variability of system software evoked by the
	non-functional properties of operating-system functions,
	which emerges from
	(a) different implementations of the same system function to make
	an appearance of certain non-functional properties and
	(b) the using level of those implementations
	in order to compensate for effects of these properties.

	With this project, the undertaker, we provide tools to examine and evaluate
	CPP based source files. See ​VAMOS or ​CADOS for more information.
